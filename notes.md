  * Projection surface datasheet summary:
    * Evonik ACRYLITE® Grey 7D006 RP Optical PMMA (High Resolution)
    * Categories: Polymer; Thermoplastic; Acrylic (PMMA)
    * Material notes: ACRYLITE® Optical rear projection (RP) is especially developed for rear projection to ensure optimal image generation in this demanding application. The base material is highly transparent PMMA with excellent light transmission (92%). It offers very good mechanical strength, which makes the rear projection screens extremely durable. Evonik Cyro LLC offers two types of rear projection screens that are optimized for different applications. The Daylight Screen is 3mm thick and is a universal product that is suitable for every environment. It represents the ideal compromise between contrast, gain and half-gain. All this is combined with an excellent price/performance ratio and a tough configuration.
